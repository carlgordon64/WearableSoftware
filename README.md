# WearableSoftware

This commit is just a save state before I start integrating the Bluetooth Functionality.
I have a strong ble connection set up in another sketch but didnt want to risk bringing it in and comprimising the working data structure.

Whats Next?

- Bring in Bluetooth-Incoming connection from port [6] and make sure it is recieving the correct values from the arduino UNO.

-Set up a potentiometer in the same circuit as the Bluetooth Module and have the values from that print through the Bluetooth module. These values can be divided into ranges to test how garment interaction will affect the code.
