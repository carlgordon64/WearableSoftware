Here I have re designed the carousel indicator, cleaning up the animation by adding a color transition and moving into a more flat / material design style.

Whats Next?

- Make cards/panels open to fullscreen on toggle but pad the content within them by about 50px.

- Add the status text to the top right corner.

- cards should have individual labels that are displayed on touch rather than displaying all labels at once (probably use color fade effect for this too).
